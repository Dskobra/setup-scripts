# setup-scripts
Personal scripts for quickly setting up normal packages i use on fedora/openSUSE.
Ignore the mess. :P

folder layout
-------------
root
* mangohud          - formely game profiles. Now in a separate branch and script pulls from there.
* setup.sh          - launch script. everything is now in the modules folder.
* containers.sh     - mostly for putting clamav in a container. atm keeping this to experiment with containers.
* unix.sh           - i sometimes use windows which causes the line endings to not be in unix format. this fixes it.
