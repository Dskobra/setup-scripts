# setup-scripts
My personal scripts for setting up Fedora quick on my pc.
Includes my normal programs and other stuff. Ignore the mess. :P

folder layout

root
* mangohud          - game profiles.
* setup.sh          - main script. contains all the normal packages I use.
* containers.sh     - mostly for putting clamav in a container. atm keeping this to experiment with containers
* unix.sh           - i sometimes use windows which causes the line endings to not be in unix format. this fixes it.
