# setup-scripts
Personal scripts for quickly setting up normal packages i use on fedora.
Ignore the mess. :P

folder layout
-------------
root
* modules           - stores all the package commands. Organized by distro.
* setup.sh          - launch script. Checks what distro it's running on.
* unix.sh           - i sometimes use windows which causes the line endings to not be in unix format. this fixes it.
