# setup-scripts
My personal scripts for setting up Fedora quick on my pc.
Includes my normal programs and other stuff. Ignore the mess. :P

These are my scripts to automate setting up Fedora.

folder layout
-------------
root
* sources - All the main installation scripts.
* extras - mostly a script to download GloriousEggroll custom proton and wine for lutris/steam.


*Important scripts in root directory
* setup.sh - launch script
* cleanup.sh - removes kwrite and libreoffice non flatpak version.
* unix.sh - i sometimes use windows which causes the line endings to not be in unix format. This fixes it.

*Random notes
I prefer to have things grouped together and reuse code as much as possible.
