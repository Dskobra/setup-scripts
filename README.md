# setup-scripts
My personal scripts for setting up Fedora quick on my pc.
Includes my normal programs and other stuff. Ignore the mess. :P

folder layout
-------------
root
* mangohud - game profiles.
* setup.sh - main script
* unix.sh - i sometimes use windows which causes the line endings to not be in unix format. This fixes it.

*Random notes
I prefer to have things grouped together and reuse code as much as possible.
