# setup-scripts
My personal scripts for setting up Fedora quick on my pc.
Includes my normal programs and other stuff. Ignore the mess. :P

folder layout
-------------
root
* custom - scripts for setting up my desktop shortcuts, profiles etc.


*Important scripts in root directory
* setup.sh - launch script
* deck.sh - script I made for installing some frequently used apps on my steam deck.
* cleanup.sh - removes some unwanted packages such as kwrite and libreoffice non flatpak version.
* unix.sh - i sometimes use windows which causes the line endings to not be in unix format. This fixes it.

*Random notes
I prefer to have things grouped together and reuse code as much as possible.
