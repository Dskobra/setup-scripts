* mangohud          - game profiles.
* setup.sh          - launcher script
* ostree_setup.sh   - installs packages for fedora silverblue/kinoite using rpm-ostree.
* dnf_setup.sh      - old script that uses dnf.
* containers.sh     - installs specific packages in containers. not quite ready.
* unix.sh           - i sometimes use windows which causes the line endings to not be in unix format. This fixes it.
